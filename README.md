# Robloxian

Robloxian is a Python cheat for Roblox. It works using the TeleportData in Roblox. In the TeleportData we place our injection script. But we can't use it yet, in order to execute that script we overwrite the Animate script avaliable in your character. Now all you need to do is to reset your character and use the executor.

## Disclaimer

This code is prone to crashing and getting detected. However I am working on fixing this soon. If you want to help you can create an issue or a pull request.

## Installation

This expects that you have the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-amd64.exe) installed on your computer.

**Step 1**.
Clone the github repository to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wello-gh/robloxian
```

**Step 2**.
Install the dependencies using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 3**.
Run the program.

```bash
cd ./robloxian
py main.py
```

## Origins

This code was originally taken from Chaos which is a Roblox Python cheat. Chaos code is very bad and under-maintained so I decided to re-write it for the public. The owner of Chaos does not know how to code and makes his developers do all of the work for him. He uses AI tools to fix his own mess.
